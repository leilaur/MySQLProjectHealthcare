### Dataset Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset

## Overview

The initial dataset contained numerous duplicates and required name standardization to enhance clarity and usability.

The objective is to clean the data, making it more suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization as needed.

### Key Takeaways from this Project

- Creating staging tables as necessary.
- Identifying and removing duplicates across various columns.
- Standardizing data columns
- Reordering columns following data standardization.

Out of the original 55,500 entries, 5,500 were identified as duplicates and removed. Original columns were retained for comparison with the revised data.
